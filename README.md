## Description
Have you ever needed a Book Search app to track the books you want to read? Look no further! This Book Search Engine app was created for the avid reader to help keep track of the books they want to read. Users will be able to create a profile on the app and search for books using the Google Books API. The search will return up to 10 books that match the search query, and users will be able to add books to their list and delete books from the list as well.

## Installation
First, type "cd -directory-name" in your terminal to access the folder where the app is located. Once you're in the correct folder, type "npm i" or "npm install" to install all of the necessary packages. Next, type "npm run build" to build the application to prepare it for deployment. Once that's done, type "npm run develop" to deploy the app on your local server.

## Usage
Users can use this app to search for books, add books to their list, and remove books from their list. The main purpose of this app is to help readers keep track of books they may want to read and delete them when they're finished reading the book. To demonstrate how this app is used, watch a short clip of the app in action here: 

## Contribution
Thank you to Columbia University Coding Bootcamp for providing me with the starter code needed to build this app. The lessons taught during the Bootcamp have helped me immensely in completing the coding for this app. If you have any ideas or changes that you'd think would improve the app, feel free to fork the repo and create a pull request. I'm more than interested in learning what I can do to improve as a coder. Also, please give this app a star! I'd truly appreciate it!
