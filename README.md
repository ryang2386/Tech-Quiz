## Description
Ever wanted to test your tech skills and find out which areas you need to improve? I've got you covered with the Tech Quiz app! This app will ask you ten tech questions, and after you're finished, your score will be revealed, and you'll have the option to re-take the test! 

## Installation
* Type "cd -directory-name" in your terminal to access the folder where the app is located.
* Type "npm i" or "npm install" to install all the necessary packages.
* Next, type "npm run build" to build the application.
* Once built, type "npm run seed" to load the questions, choices, and answers.
* Afterward, the last step is to type "npm run start:dev" to deploy the app!

## Usage
This app can be used by anyone willing to learn more about tech and coding in general. Also, I've added the Cypress component and e2e testing to ensure that the components are working as they should. For an example on how to run the tests on the app, please refer to the walkthrough video I've provided below:

## Contribution
Columbia University Coding Bootcamp provided the code for the Tech Quiz to work. I was tasked with creating tests for the app using Cypress. I'm grateful for the lessons taught at Columbia because it provided me with the tools needed to complete the Cypress testing code for the app. If you'd like to run more tests on the app, feel free to fork the repo and create a pull request. I'd like to see the other tests you can develop based on the code. Also, please give this app a star! I'd truly appreciate it!

## Tests
Included in the code for the app, I've added Cypress component and e2e testing. For further testing, please fork the repo and test the app further. If you're having difficulty figuring out what command(s) to use in the terminal to run the tests, please refer to my walkthrough video above!
